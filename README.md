# FOR-2024 Foundations of Operations Research 2024/2025
These are the files that I copied during the labs or that I wrote as exercises for the class of 2024/2025 of Foundations of Operations Research, which I followed during the first semester of my first year of my Master's Degree at Politecnico di Milano. Credits due to Professor E. Amaldi and Dr. M. Cubillos.
